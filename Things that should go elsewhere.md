Freelancer Hyperpulse

	A human dressed in a patchwork of different Rimhopper fashions steps forward from the crowd, he announces he cannot only fix the heater the raiders broke, but also fight them off the planet, all they needed to do was to give him until the end of the rotation. The colonists whisper amongst themselves, questioning if this offworlder could even fathom pulling such a stunt off, and, much to their pleasant surprise, as the twin suns fall under the horizon, they not only have heating, but do not need to worry about the raiders ever again.
	  An ovlan in combat gear slams a notice on the desk of a tavernkeep, its a slot for a dancer. The tavernkeep looks up at her and questions if she took the wrong paper, she just ear flips and tells them to audition her. Later that day, she is the main attraction in the orbital's Symphonica Night.
	  Those are examples of Freelancers, individuals that possess a wide array of talents and abilities, jacks-of-all-trades if one wishes to use that label. Due to this, Freelancer characters can choose their own array of Knowledges and Starting Equipment relating to them by default, all of that is, of course, under Worldshaper discretion.

Skirmisher Hyperpulse

	An armored mirai huddles near a downed fightercraft, they check the ammo of their magrifle, empty. They scoff as they pull out an intricate cutting surface from their belt, a fractal slasher, and vault over the cover, head first into an enemy aggressor, ripping their spacesuit with a clean arm movement.
	  An ellitro walks into a monastery, sheathed on her back are 5 swords, all of different styles and materials, and on her mouth stands a pipe that slowly bellows out a soft, fragrant smoke. One of the bandits that have wrangled control of the monastery turns to her, before they can say anything or lift their LARB revolver, they are on the ground, large gash running across their belly, and two swords, now unsheathed, wait to give the same destiny to this bandit's comrades.
	  Those are examples of Skirmishers, individuals that possess talent with wielding weaponry and dancing to the tune of battle. Due to this, Skirmisher characters choose the Expertise Knowledge relating to the weapon they desire and their Starting Equipment is one geared towards the fight.

Technician Hyperpulse

	Alarms blare, smoke fills titanium aluminide corridors, the cruiser's main reactor is about to burst into an echo cascade, but a caldovex is huddled near the power management array, a heavy toolbox open, tools scattered around. With the precise movements of his four arms the power is rerouted, the alarms slowly die down, the main reactor is staying integral one more day, the caldovex gets up, its time to deal with the fire.
	  A drone delivers a crate of parts to an arvox, they thank the drone and go back to focusing on the work surface and the empty schematic paper on top of it, with an elegant movement, they start planning something. A few hours go by, eventually, they come of their workshop triumphant, and in their hands is a never seen before shield coil array.
	  Those are examples of Technicians, individuals that possess talent with machines and the sciences of the galaxy.

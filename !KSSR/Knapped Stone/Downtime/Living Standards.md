Living Standards are how a character lives during their downtimes, their costs (per day) take in consideration the amount of civilization in a given area, the more civilized, the costlier are the life standards and, with it, greater are the monetary rewards jobs give you. If, for some reason, your character ends up having downtime in the middle of the wilderness, there is a table for the time (per day) the character would need to put aside to acquire things for their survival.

The prices/times and time may vary, and the tables bellow should only be taken as an average.

## Within Civilization

 ----- | Frontier | Rural | Small Sat. | Large Sat. | Center
 ----- | -------- | ----- | ---------- | ---------- | ------
Squalor | 0 Valuables | 0 Valuables | 0 Valuables | 0 Valuables | 0 Valuables
Poor | 1 Valuable | 2 Valuables | 3 Valuables | 5 Valuables | 10 Valuables
Modest | 3 Valuables | 5 Valuables | 8 Valuables | 10 Valuables | 15 Valuables
Wealthy | 5 Valuables | 10 Valuables | 15 Valuables | 20 Valuables | 35 Valuables
Lavish | 35 Valuables | 50 Valuables | 80 Valuables | 100 Valuables | 250 Valuables

Squalor - The poorest of the living conditions. Living on the streets, taking shelter in abandoned barns, unkept buildings, barrels and crates or even in the sewers, unsure if you will have food or a plate to eat whatever you are able to find. Beggars, exiles and other forms of invisibilized minorities live like this.
Characters that live in Squalor conditions are only those that were unable to find a job, lodging with their organization/factions, a fortune, amongst other forms of dignified survival. In Squalor living conditions, you are affected by the following:
> Every Month of your Downtime, take 1 Exposure Damage. If the area you are is currently experiencing seasons of Cold or Hot weather, roll 3D6, take any successes plus 1 Exposure Damage. If the weather is Frigid or Melting, roll 6D6 instead;
> 
> At the end of each Downtime Month, roll a D6 for every level of civilization you are in (a Frontier would have you rolling 1D6, while a Center would have you rolling 5D6), every success is a Valuable you have gained via begging, petty thievery, among other means. You may choose to spend any amount of those Valuables to avoid the same amount of Exposure Damage you would take;
> 
> Every Downtime Trimester (3 Months), roll Focus, if you do not acquire a success, you misplaced, lost, or were a victim of a theif that took an item of the Worldshaper's choice;
> 
> The time needed to learn a new Knowledge or to Gain a new Attribute Point is raised by a week, as you need to spend energy staving off hunger and having restless nights trying to survive your current situation.
> 
**Note: It is possible for a character to die of Exposure Damage while living in Squalor conditions.**

Poor - You live at the edge of society, vulnerable to the most extreme of weathers and often times violence, but at least you have food in your plate and a proper roof over your head. Unskilled laborers, farmers and other workers of primary services, like mining, live like this.
You can only live in Poor Living Standards if you either have a job, a fortune, or lodging with your organization/faction. In the latter case, you do not need to pay anything, but you probably gain a small or no form of salary. In places where the grasp of civilization is weak, you may gain food and a roof in exchange for a job, but not a salary, in both cases, you don't have to pay your living costs.
Characters living in Poor conditions are under the following effects:
> Every Month of your Downtime that the region you are experiences Frigid or Melting Weather, take 1 Exposure Damage unless you spend 1 Valuable to acquire materials to ward the elements;
>
> At the end of each Downtime Month, roll a D6 for every level of civilization you are in (a Frontier would have you rolling 1D6, while a Center would have you rolling 5D6), every success is a Valuable you have gained from odd jobs, freelancing or as extra from your work;
>
> Every Downtime Semester (6 Months), roll Focus, if you do not acquire a success, you misplaced, lost, or were a victim of a theif that took an item of the Worldshaper's choice.
> 
**Note: It is possible for a character to die of Exposure Damage while living in Poor conditions.**

Modest - You live at middle strata of civilization, largely beneath most important people's notice. You have a roof that can weather even extreme cold and heat without much effort, have a modest supply of food in your pantry and are rarely be involved in situations where violence and thievery happen. Artisans, soldiers and workers of secondary services, like shopkeeps, live like this.
You can only live in Modest Living Standards if you either have a job, a fortune, or lodging with your organization/faction. In the latter case, you do not need to pay anything, but you probably gain a small salary. In places where the grasp of civilization is weak, you may gain food and a roof in exchange for a job and a smaller salary, in both cases, you don't have to pay your living costs.
Characters living in Modest conditions are under the following effects:
> At the end of each Downtime Month, roll a 2D6 for every level of civilization you are in (a Frontier would have you rolling 2D6, while a Center would have you rolling 10D6), every success is a Valuable you have gained from odd jobs, freelancing or as extra from your work;
>
> Every Downtime Year, roll Focus, if you do not acquire a success, you misplaced, lost, or were a victim of a theif that took an item of the Worldshaper's choice.

Wealthy - You live in comfort, meddling with the lowest strata of the high society, which, to be honest, is more then most people can afford. Your living standards are beyond any artisan's and you access to many different commodities others wouldn't even dream of. Important merchants, highly skilled workforce and large business owners, like factory owners, live like this.
You can only live in Wealthy Living Standards if you have a job, or a fortune.
Characters living in Wealthy conditions are under the following effects:
> At the end of each Downtime Month, roll 2D6 for every level of civilization you are in (a Frontier would have you rolling 2D6, while a Center would have you rolling 10D6), every success is a Valuable you have gained from business negotiations, dividends or as extra from your work;
> 
> If you have any unpaid Favors, you may utilize your status and/or wealth to pay one of them during your Downtime, but only if the Favor is yet to be Redeemed. This is, of course, under Worldshaper discretion.

Lavish - You are the creme-de-la-creme of society, the top of the top. Only nobility, mega-corp owners or anyone with a similar position is able to live like this.
You can only live in Lavish Living Standards if you have a fortune.
Characters living in Lavish conditions are under the following effects:
> At the end of each Downtime Month, roll 5D6 for every level of civilization you are in (a Frontier would have you rolling 5D6, while a Center would have you rolling 25D6), every success is a Valuable you have gained from business negotiations, dividends or investments;
> 
> If you have any unpaid Favors, you may utilize your status and/or wealth to pay two of them during your Downtime, but only if the Favor is yet to be Redeemed. This is, of course, under Worldshaper discretion.



Frontier - The Frontier is the very edge of civilization, places with little to no comforts and in near wilderness conditions. The cost of day-to-day life is (relatively) low here, but pay is either also small or comes in the form of food and lodging, as money is no good for a pioneer trying their hardest to survive the wilderness.

Rural - Rural areas are places where civilization gathers their primary goods like food and ore. They have their little quirks and comforts and day-to-day life has a bareble price, as well as money actually having some value. Jobs here can exchange a part of their salary for lodging and food.

Small Satellite (Small Sat.) - Small towns at the edges of the largest civilized centers. Cozy, comfortable places where everyone knows everyone and low living costs. Jobs in these places typically pay completely in money.

Large Satellite (Large Sat.) - Large towns or small cities at the edges of the largest civilized centers. Somewhere between the cozyness of Small Satellites and the sheer size of large Centers of civilization, it serves as the habitable zones for all matters of artisans, shopkeeps, among others, that would be crushed by big city competition.

Center - Large cities with big populations. High cost of life, but filled to the brim with many services that make life easier. Also, pay is higher here and temporary job opportunities are typically plenty.



## In the Wilderness
"In the wilderness, we are equal" is a saying said by many an adventurer and, while true, this expression carries a bit of a lie: People in the wilderness are only equal when the wilderness in question has similar conditions. Someone in a lush jungle is in a completely different condition than someone in the middle of a cold desert, and some would even say the latter has a LOT of disadvantages.

Nature's money is time, as such, if you desire to take your Downtime in the wilds, you must take a portion of your day to look for food, drink and the means to ward the elements. The amount of time will depend on the conditions of the biome you are in, as shown in the table bellow.

 Condition | Time per Day 
 --------- | ------------
 Lush | 4 Hours
 Mild | 5 Hours
 Hostile | 6 Hours
 Inhospitable | 8 Hours

Independent of the Condition of the biome in question, a character living in the wilderness is under the following conditions:
> Every Month of your Downtime where you are exposed to Cold or Hot weather, roll 3D6, take any successes plus 1 Exposure Damage. If the weather is Frigid or Melting, roll 6D6 instead;
> 
> You may spend 2 extra hours to find extra materials to deal with the Cold or Hot weather and, if you do so, do not take Exposure Damage. If you are exposed to Frigid or Melting weather, spend 4 extra hours;
> 
> You may include a training routine for Body, Mind, or Focus in your survival routines. You may only choose to do so if the next level needs the same or less Time per Day as your survival routines and if you are not training the same attribute already;
> 
> Every Downtime Semester (6 Months), roll Focus, if you do not acquire a success, you misplaced, or lost an item of the Worldshaper's choice.
> 
**Note: It is possible for a character to die of Exposure Damage while Downtiming in the Wilderness.**

Lush - Lush biomes are rich in food, drink and useful, easy to access materials. Jungles and coastal forests are good examples of such biomes.

Mild - Mild biomes have an average, survivable amount of food, drink and useful, easy to access materials. Plains, temperate forests and savannas are good examples of such biomes.

Hostile - Hostile biomes have low amounts of food, drink and useful, easy to access materials. Semi-arids, tundras and small islands are good examples of such biomes.

Inhospitable - Inhospitable biomes have near to no resources needed for survival. Hot and cold deserts are good examples of such biomes.

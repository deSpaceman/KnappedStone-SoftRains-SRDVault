A Tabletop Role-Playing Game, also referred to as Tabletop RPG or TTRPG, is a hybrid between storytelling, improv theater, and game played primarily with pen, paper, many different dice, and your imagination.

Meanwhile one of the players will take the place of the storyteller, known as the [[1.2.3 - The Worldshaper|Worldshaper]], and will be responsible to narrate the world, control characters that do not belong to the other players, and, most importantly, set the stage for the players to act by interpreting their actions and [[1.3.1 - 6 Sided Dice|rolls]] and defining their results and reactions.

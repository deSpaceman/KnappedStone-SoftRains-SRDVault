As with any Tabletop RPG system, the objective of Knapped Stone is to tell a story. In this case, a story of individuals surviving cityscapes and wilderness alike, defeating foes stronger than them, unraveling mysteries of things long forgotten, and becoming heroes by overcoming the odds and the challenges to do so by bringing together their skills and wits.

By nature, this is a cooperative game with no win condition: the game ends when the story ends, either by tragedy or by success. As such, don't come into a table of Knapped Stone & Soft Rains expecting a competition, come in expecting a good time with friends, working together and telling the story of your characters.

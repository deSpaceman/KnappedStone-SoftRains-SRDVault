While a TTRPG game is mostly storytelling and acting out your characters, there is a need for some degree of randomness to have fairness and instill a sense of tension into the narrative. For that end, dice are used.

Different systems used different dice in different amounts, like the famed 20 sided dice (D20), a symbol of the hobby. This system does not use the D20, nor any other other size of dice apart from the humble D6 for that matter.

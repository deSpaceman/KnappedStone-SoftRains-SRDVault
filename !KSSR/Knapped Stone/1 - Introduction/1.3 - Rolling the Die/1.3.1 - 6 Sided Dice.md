While a TTRPG game is mostly storytelling and acting out your characters, there is a need for some degree of randomness to have fairness and instill a sense of tension into the narrative. For that end, dice are used.

Different systems used different dice in different amounts, like the famed 20 sided dice (D20), a symbol of the hobby. This system does not use the D20, nor any other other size of dice apart from the humble D6.

Dice are rolled during Tests, moments during the game where a Creature has a significant chance of failure. The amount of dice is defined by the attribute required for the Test (E.G.: A Creature with 3 Body is performing a Body-related Test, like stopping a rolling boulder, it will roll 3D6, while a Creature with 5 Body would roll 5D6) and the difficulty to succeed in a Test is defined by the amount of Successes you require to clear it.

A Success is considered when a D6 lands with the number 6 or 5 face up. If a dice lands with a 1 face up, that is considered a [[1.3.2 - Mishaps|Mishap]]. If it otherwise lands with a 2, 3, or 4 face up, it is called a neutral result and, unless no dice resulted in Successes, do not factor in when accounting for the Test results. If four D6 land as Successes, that is considered a [[1.3.3 - Criticals|Critical Success]], if they otherwise land as Mishaps, that is considered a Greater Mishap.

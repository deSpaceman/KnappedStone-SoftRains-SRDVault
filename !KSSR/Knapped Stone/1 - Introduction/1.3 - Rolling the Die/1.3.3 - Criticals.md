-Explain that Critical Successes/Greater Mishaps stack-

### Critical Successes
-Explain that Critical Successes tips the balance of the situation for the Creature that rolled them-

### Greater Mishaps
The inverse of a Critical Success is a Greater Mishap, which occurs when 4 Mishaps are rolled in a given roll.

Greater Mishaps always result in the Creature that rolled them being put in an unfavorable position, within common sense. An axe shattering when hitting soft wood, an enemy swordsman disarming and taking your sword in a single swipe, or a supposed gold nugget turning out to be pyrite.

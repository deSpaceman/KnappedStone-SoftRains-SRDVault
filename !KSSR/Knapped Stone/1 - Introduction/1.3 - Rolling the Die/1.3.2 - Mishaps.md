Mishaps constitute the unplanned results of an action: a bullet ricocheting, a beast leaping from the tree that was just felled, a gemstone is revealing itself when stone is broken are all examples of such occurrences. As implied, Mishaps are not necessarily bad and, in some cases, may be good to the Creature that rolled them, and that is because they are a tool to change the narrative balance of a situation.

-Explain a Greater Mishap always tips the situation against the Creature that rolled them-

A roll with no Success, in other words, a failure, always results in a Mishap, independent of the amount of Mishaps or neutral results rolled. That means that failures should always result in a new situation presenting itself.

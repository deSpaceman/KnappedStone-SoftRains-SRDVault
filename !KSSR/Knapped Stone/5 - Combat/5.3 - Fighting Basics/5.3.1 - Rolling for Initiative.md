When combat begins, all participants of the combat scene called the Initiative Roll, using the Focus Attribute. Initiative defines who goes first in the turn order of the round, from most successes to least successes.

In case of a tie, tie breaking is done by following the priority list bellow, in descending order:

1 - Player
2 - Player-Opposing Creatures
3 - Player-Allied Creatures

-Add example-

If [[1.3.3 - Criticals|Critical Successes]] are rolled during an Initiative Roll, the Creature that rolled it gains an amount of extra turns equivalent to the amount of Critical Successes it got. Those turns are placed at the end of the initiative order, following the priority list in case of ties.

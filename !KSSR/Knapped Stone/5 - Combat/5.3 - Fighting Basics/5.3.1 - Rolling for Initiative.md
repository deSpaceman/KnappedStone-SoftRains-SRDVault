When combat begins, all participants of the combat scene do a roll called the Initiative Roll, using the Focus Attribute. Initiative defines who goes first in the turn order of the round, from most successes to least successes.

In case of a tie, tie breaking is done by following the priority list bellow, in descending order:

1 - Player Characters
2 - Player-Opposing Creatures
3 - Player-Allied Creatures

> Combat begins, and during the Initiative Roll, Arthur (Ellysa's character), his Knaw, and one of the Wormbeasts attacking them all roll 2 Successes. This means they are tied in the initiative order.
> The Worldshaper applies the tiebreaker rule making the order:
- First is Arthur, as he is a Player Character
- Second is the Wormbeast, as it is a Player-Opposing Creature
- Third is Arthur's Knaw, as they are a Player-Allied Creature

If [[1.3.3 - Criticals|Critical Successes]] are rolled during an Initiative Roll, the Creature that rolled it gains an amount of extra turns equivalent to the amount of Critical Successes it got. Those turns are placed at the end of the initiative order, following the priority list in case of ties.

> Returning to the turn order of the last example, lets us imagine that another character, named Aeosh, rolled 4 Successes (I.E.: A Critical Success). The turn order would look like so:
- Aeosh's First Turn
- Arthur
- Wormbeast
- Arthur's Knaw
- Aeosh's Second Turn

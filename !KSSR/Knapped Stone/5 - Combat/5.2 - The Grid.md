The Grid is the surface where combat is fought. The spaces in the grid (Gridspaces) can be square, hexagonal, or just forsaken completely in favor of using a ruler to measure them by the centimeter, granted it can be used to tell the positions of Creatures in relation to each other, it works as the Grid.

Due to the setting-agnostic nature of Knapped Stone & Soft Rains, the size of a Gridspace changes depending on the setting (E.G.: A setting were the characters are all bugs could have Gridspaces equate to half a centimeter). It can also change depending on the situation the characters are facing within the setting (E.G.: A battle between spaceships could have Gridspaces be kilometers in size). 

For any setting that works with nearly human-sized creatures, a Gridspace is 1 meter (or roughly 3 feet) in size, give or take.

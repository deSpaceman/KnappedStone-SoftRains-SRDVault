As this system is survival focused, killing off characters in an unceremonious manner, such as starvation, is not as frowned upon as other TTRPG systems. Alas, unceremonious death shouldn't be a common occurrence still, and should only happen when players place themselves in those kinds of situations.

Also due to the nature of the system, death is intended to be permanent, or, at the very least, nearly impossible to be reverted. During a campaign it should serve two purposes, one mechanical and one storytelling:

The mechanical purpose is simple to understand, death rips away an important component of group composition, especially if they are somewhere away from civilization. Taking with it the skills and knowledge of that individual. 

The storytelling purpose is a tad bit more complex, it is how the players deal with loss and, more importantly, how their characters deal with loss. How they will move forward and confront the challenges ahead, missing someone that had valuable emotional connections with them, for the wilderness is large and good friends are too few.

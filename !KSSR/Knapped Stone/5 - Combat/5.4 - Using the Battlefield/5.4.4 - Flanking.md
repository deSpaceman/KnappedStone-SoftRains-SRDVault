Flanking is one of the most tactically valuable technique, serving as a threatening form board control. It is a somewhat complicated mechanic, so diagrams will be provided when possible.

### How to Flank
To start, Flanking only affects a target adjacent to the would be flankers. Apart from that, flanks are considered invalid if a moving at least one [[5.2 - The Grid|Gridspace]] would put the flankers adjacent to each other like so:

If a Flank is valid, an area in the shape of a cross of a flanker is considered the Threat Area, like so:

The Threat Area demarcates the Gridspaces in which the flanked Creature can't move into without having an [[5.3.2 - Action Economy|Opportunity Attack]] done to them, even if they take the Disengage Action. On top of that, the flanked Creature cannot Dodge into the Threat Area.

This means that valid Flanks behaves like so:

The green arrows represent where the flanked Creature can move and have its Disengage Action be valid or Dodge to.

### Special Situations
There are two special situations with Flanking: Third Person Flanking and Unreachable Person Flanking.

Third Person Flanking is when an ally of the flankers puts themself into the way of the flanked Creature, blocking one of their possible escape routes like so:

Unreachable Person Flanking presents an exception to the one Gridspace invalidation rule. Where, if one of the flankers is completely unreachable by the other, be it by flying or by having elevated ground and a [[3.3.2 - Weapons|Weapon]] with the [[4.2.1 - Item Keywords|Reach Keyword]], it still constitutes a Flank, even if moving one Gridspace would set them adjacent.

### Counter-Flanking
Counter-Flaking is a situation where a flanker is the target of a Flank that has the Creature they are Flanking as a flanker (Note: They must not be a Third Person). If that happens, both Flanks are invalidated.

Cover is a much needed edge when it comes to combat, it allows a creature to avoid damage or better weather it, depending on the cover size, of course. There are two sizes of cover: Full and Half, their effects are as listed below.

- Half Cover makes attackers have Disadvantage 2 in their rolls against any creature that is in Half Cover conditions;

- Full Cover makes the creature using it unable to be harmed by attacks, save in two different situations: The creature in Full Cover attacks, an attacker can execute an attack roll against them with Disadvantage 4 during the round the attack happened or the attacker uses tools, weapons, or spells that can phase through walls, although the attacker would need to guess where their target is (apply Situational Disadvantage as needed).

To have the effects listed above, a creature must be adjacent to the source of cover and the attacker must be opposite to it.

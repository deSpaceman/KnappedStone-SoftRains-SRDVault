The world is a ruthless place, and to face the harsh hammer of survival, you must know yourself and your capabilities. This is where this chapter comes in, it carries the instructions for character creation.

Don't expect to have amazing magic or godly strength, you are a Survivor, the rank and file of society that has answered the call of adventure either by choice or force. It is always good to remember that the odds are stacked against you: any well aimed shot, precise cut, and heavy bludgeoning will leave you at death's door. To make things worse, the bony hand of hunger and the grim specter of exhaustion stalk your every move, waiting for the moment they can claim your mind, body, and soul.

But, by uniting together the skills and wits (and with some luck and effort on the side), you and your fellows may be able to face these challenges head on and succeed, turning into Legends in the process.

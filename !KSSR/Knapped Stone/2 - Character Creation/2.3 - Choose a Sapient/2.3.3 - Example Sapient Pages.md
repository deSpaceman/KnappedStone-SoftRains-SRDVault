### Human
Humans are an example of a baseline and equilibrated Sapient.
Apparence-wise, humans resamble hairless apes that stand upright, their skin ranges from coal black to bark brown to bone white to mustard-ish white; Their eyes can range from amber to brown to green to blue; Their hair can range from nightsky black to platinum white and, in rare cases, their hair can be orange-ish red to blood red.
Humans are a strange people that are able to quickly learn things and replicate them, a feat that has allowed humanity to survive far beyond their limited capabilities. Thanks to this mimicry, humans are unpredictable at best, and even the most isolated settlements can have humans with extremely different ideals and goals living within the palisades.

During the process of Character Creation, the player may shift up to 2 Attribute Points between Health, Body, Mind, Focus, Dodge and Toughness, like so:

> Ellysa is planning on making a Human character called Arthur, she wants Arthur to be a strong and tough, albeit dimwitted and air headed person. To do this, she shifts 1 Attribute Point from Mind to Body and 1 Attribute Point from Focus to Toughness, changing Arthur's Attribute distribution from:

Name | Class | HP | Bdy | Mnd | Fcs | Lck | Dge | Tgn | Mvt | Keywords
---- | ----- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------
Arthur (Human) | Humanoid | 12 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 4 | Sapient, Repeat Learner

> To:

Name | Class | HP | Bdy | Mnd | Fcs | Lck | Dge | Tgn | Mvt | Keywords
---- | ----- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------
Arthur (Human) | Humanoid | 12 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Sapient, Repeat Learner

> Ellysa cannot do anymore attribute shifts, as she already has done the 2 available to her.

It is important to point out that you may not shift Attributes in a way that would leave you with 0 points in that Attribute.

The player may also choose to sacrifice 1 Attribute Point of their choice between Health, Body, Mind, Perception, Dodge and Toughness to gain one extra Knowledge later in the process of Character Creation. You may not sacrifice a point in an Attribute that would leave it at 0.

Trades are similar in nature to classes found in other RPGs but, instead of locking the playstyle of a player to one thing permanently, they allow the player to slowly change or add to their specialization given they have [[2.7.3 - Gaining Knowledge during the Game|enough time to invest on it]]. A good rule of thumb is to think of a Trade as a job the character had before starting their adventuring life.

A Trade should give the player a few items, one or two [[2.7.1 - What are Knowledges|Knowledges]] and [[2.4.1 - Attributes|Attribute]] increments. For further reference, the Worldshaper may refer to [[2.5.2 - Creating Trades|Creating Trades]].

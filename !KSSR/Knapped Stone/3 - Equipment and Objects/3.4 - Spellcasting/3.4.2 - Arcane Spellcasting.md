Arcane spellcasting is more akin to science than to the magic of fiction: spells are programmed into metal, crystal, and other types of assorted material and souls are pushed through them in their way to be released into the environment from a [[3.4.3 - Soul Phylactery|Soul Phylactery]], in essence powering the circuits and outputting a spell. Putting what was described above in layman's terms, to do arcane magic you need:

-   A magic focus with, at least, one programmed spell circuit in it;
-   A Soul Phylactery with at least same amount of Souls as the Soul Cost of the spell programmed in the circuit inside;
-   Succeed whatever test the spell asks of you;
-   Independent if the spell succeeded or not, use up as many Souls as the Soul Cost of the spell.

As one may notice, a Creature can only cast spells programmed into the spell circuit, which is typically one measly spell. Anyhow, Creatures with innate magic may have access to spells, listed in their keywords as "Spell: (Name)", if that is the case, treat that spell as an Arcane Spell, but do not apply a Soul Cost to it.

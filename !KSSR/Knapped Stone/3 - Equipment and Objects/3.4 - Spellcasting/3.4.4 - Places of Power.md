Places of Power are areas where the magic currents converge, accumulating ambient Souls and energies that can be easily tapped by [[3.4.2 - Arcane Spellcasting|Spellcasters]] and their [[3.4.3 - Soul Phylactery|Phylacteries]].

Most Places of Power near sapient civilizations have been turned either into research stations of the arcane or worship locations. Due to that, those places often are lacking significant amount of Souls to be tapped or used by Spellcasters. Places of Power found in the untamed wilderness or forgotten ruins of civilizations will be teeming with Souls, and would supply a Spellcaster with more Souls than they will ever need in their lifetime... that is, if they can survive the journey to such places.

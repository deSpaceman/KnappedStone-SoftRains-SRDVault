While some find power in the half-physics half-metaphysics of arcane magic, others find strength in the power of belief and in the divine. Those who call upon such powers typically find themselves holding their holy symbols tight, reciting rites and prayers and hoping they are heard. As such, to do Divine magic you need:

-   Knowledge that pertains to the rites of the religion you intend on invoking;
-   The Holy Symbol of said religion;
-   Succeeding a Focus roll with the difficulty (called Mantra Difficulty) listed in the spell list;
-   Succeed whatever test the spell asks of you;
-   If you fail the Focus roll, the spell is not summoned and an extra Mishap is applied on top of the pre-existing Mishaps.

As said in the necessities list, Divine Spellcasting comes with a pre-defined spell list. An example of a list is as follows:

Spell | Mantra Difficulty
---------- | -----------------
Ascending Grace | 2
Concentration Break | 2
Smite | 3
Celestial Beam | 4

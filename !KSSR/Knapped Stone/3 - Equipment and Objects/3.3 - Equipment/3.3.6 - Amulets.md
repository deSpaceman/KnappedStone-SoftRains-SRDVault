Amulets are esoteric bits and bobs with special properties. Baubles with latent magic, pieces of ancient and poorly understood technology, and parts of powerful creatures are all possible Amulets.

Due to their very nature, Amulets are small and can be stuffed anywhere, so a Creature has no limitations on the amount of Amulets they can carry. But, due to their esoteric properties, a Creature can only have half their Focus-worth, rounded down with a minimum of 1, Amulets active (I.E.: Giving out their effect) at once.

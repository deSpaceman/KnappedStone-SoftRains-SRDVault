Consumables are items with a limited amount of uses that provide a given effect. Potions, bandages, grenades, holographic decoys, flares, glowsticks, among other things are all examples of Consumables.

Consumables may be Quickslotted, making them accessible with a [[5.3.2 - Action Economy|Free Action]]. By default, a Creature has 5 Quickslots, but this amount may be raised by [[3.3.5 - Utilities|Utilities]], [[3.3.4 - Armor|Armor]], or even [[!List of Knowledges|Knowledges]].

For the purposes of simplicity, Ammo for Ranged [[3.3.2 - Weapons|Weapons]] may be also Quickslotted. Additionally, any consumable that is logically meant for throwing has Lesser Range, but this may be extended/reduced under Worldshaper discretion.

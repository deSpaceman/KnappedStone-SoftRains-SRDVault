Armor are items that serve as a layer of protection, donned over the body. Armor is typically made out of plates, chainmail, scales, leathers, and other such materials.

All Armor have a [[4.2.1 - Item Keywords|Shielding Power]] that serves as base damage reduction it provides and some Armor will have a [[2.4.1 - Attributes|Dodge]] Penalty, reducing the Dodge of the wearer to a minimum of 1. Armor also has an amount of Utility Space that supersedes the [[3.3.5 - Utilities|amount a Creature can hold]] while Armor-less.

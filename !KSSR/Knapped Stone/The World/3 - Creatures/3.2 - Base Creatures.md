Base Creatures are Creature templates with which the Worldshaper may use to create other creatures. To signal a Creature is a Base Creature, simply put (Base) next to their name like so:

Name | Class | HP | Bdy | Mnd | Fcs | Dge | Tgn | Mvt | Keywords
---- | ----- | -- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------
Human (Base) | Humanoid | 10 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 | Sapient

Coincidentally, the Creature above also serves as a playable [[2.3.1 - What are Sapients|Sapient]] thanks to the [[4.1.1 - Creature Keywords|Sapient Keyword]] and the fact it is a Base Creature.

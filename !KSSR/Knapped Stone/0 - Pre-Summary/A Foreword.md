**This system is focused on Survival, therefore, it contains the grit found within such context. This includes death, suffering, and graphic descriptions, caused by both the perils of the environment and the actions of individuals, accidental or otherwise.**

***Player discretion is advised. Always tell your players what to expect in your campaigns.***

Welcome to Knapped Stone & Soft Rains, a passion project that has taken me years to create via trial, error, and research. This is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) system born from an itch I always had: A setting-agnostic TTRPG system with survival elements where player characters are not demi-gods, but the rank and file of society.

It also has some other elements from systems I became enamored with in my time playing TTRPGs and reading rulebooks, to the point where you can see the marks of classic systems like Shadowrun, and 3.X Edition Dungeons and Dragons, as well as (relatively speaking) hidden jewels such as Stars Without Numbers, Numenera, and Open Legend.

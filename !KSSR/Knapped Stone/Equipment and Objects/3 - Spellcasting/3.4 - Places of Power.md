Places of Power are areas where the magic currents converge, accumulating ambient Souls and energies that can be easily tapped by [[3.2 - Arcane Spellcasting|Spellcasters]] and their [[3.3 - Soul Phylactery|Phylacteries]].

Most Places of Power near sapient civilizations have been turned either into places of worship or of research into the arcane, and, as such, often find themselves lacking in a significant amount of Souls to tap. Places of Power found in the untamed wilderness or forgotten ruins of civilization will be teeming with Souls, and would supply a Spellcaster with more Souls than they will ever need in their lifetime... that is, if they can survive the trip to such places.

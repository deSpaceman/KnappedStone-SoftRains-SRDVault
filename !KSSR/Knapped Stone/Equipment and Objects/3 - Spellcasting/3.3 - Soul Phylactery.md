[[3.2 - Arcane Spellcasting]] is powered by the movement of souls in a magic circuitry, to acquire and store souls, one must have a Soul Phylactery, an eldritch mechanism that captures the souls of the recently dead or the souls stored in a place of power in itself.

Soul Phylacteries come in many shapes, forms and decorations, typically handcrafted around the Phylactery Core by the very owner of the thing. There are also different types of Soul Phylactery, some can capture ambient souls, others can recharge using concentration energy of its owner and others may be warded with protection spells the user can call upon in a desperate situation. Alas, even with all these differences, they all share the properties bellow:

-   A Soul Phylactery can only have one owner bound to it, they are the only one that can effectively tap from the Souls inside. This owner may allow others to tap from their Soul Phylactery, granted they are within Collection Range;
-   Unless stated otherwise, Soul Phylacteries have a Collection Range of 15 Movement Spaces;
-   Unless stated otherwise, Soul Phylacteries can only hold one Soul Shard;
-   Soul Phylacteries have a "soul filter" of sorts, as in, a Soul Phylactery will only keep a soul if it has enough energy to power a spell, so killing an anthill will not give thousands of souls;
-   Soul Phylacteries have a "soul agglutinator" of sorts, as in, if enough weak souls are absorbed in a short interval, they will be bundled together and count as one standard soul, so killing an anthill as quickly as humanly possibly may award a measly soul;
-   A Soul Phylactery is unbound from its owner if they stay a month apart or the owner's soul is stored within their own Phylactery. Someone with the Spellcrafting Knowledge may attempt to force-unbound a Soul Phylactery from its previous owner with a Mind Test with a Test Difficulty following the table bellow. The process can take anywhere from 1 to 6 hours.

There is a limit on the amount of Medium, Large and Huge items a Creature can carry. They are as follows:

- A Creature can carry an amount of Medium items equal to their Body plus 3;

- A Creature can only carry 1 Large item, if they choose to carry another Large item, they gain the Encumbered Condition;

- A Creature can only carry 1 Huge item if they empty out their inventory, otherwise they gain the Encumbered Condition.

There are a few exceptions to this rule:

- Equipped Armor that either has the Keyword Light or is Medium sized does not count towards the Carrying Limit;

- Creatures with the Keyword Carrier may carry 2 extra Medium items, Large items equal to their Body and 1 Huge item without emptying their inventory.

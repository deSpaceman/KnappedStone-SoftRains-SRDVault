Cover is a much needed edge when it comes to combat, it allows a creature to avoid damage or better weather it, depending on the cover size, of course. There are two sizes of cover: Full and Half, their effects are as listed bellow.

- Half Cover makes attackers have Disadvantage 2 in their rolls against any creature that is in Half Cover conditions;

- Full Cover makes the creature using it unable to be harmed by attacks, save in two different situations: the creature in Full Cover attacks, the attacker can execute an attack roll against them with Disadvantage 4 or the attacker uses tools, weapons or spells that can phase through walls.

To have the effects listed above, a creature must be adjacent to the source of cover.

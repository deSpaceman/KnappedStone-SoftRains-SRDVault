When diplomacy fails, stealth attempts are detected, or necessity simply makes it clear that civilized solutions are not viable there is no other option but to face the music and dance to the delicate, yet unrelenting, rhythm of battle. This chapter comes to assist in getting you to, hopefully, leave most of your combat encounters with all your limbs still attached and your fluids inside of you.

Of course, this chance of success depends on you and your fellows planning out how to face your enemy, grasping at any advantage that arises and pushing the battlefield into your favor by a combination of smart use of cover, flanking and other maneuvers, like pushing and grappling. Remember, every hit matters, and you don't really have that much health to spare.

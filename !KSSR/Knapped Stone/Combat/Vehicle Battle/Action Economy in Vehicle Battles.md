Vehicles do not follow the usual Action Economy, instead, any functional vehicle (as in, crewed and not broken beyond usage) within a battle has a pool of actions that can be distributed between its crew's functions. This pool starts at 1, and every crew member working in a vehicle's systems adds 1 additional action to this pool.

For example, a tank has a Piloting, a Reloading, and a Gunnery system, if there is a crew member in Piloting and another in Gunnery, the tank will have 3 actions that can be shared by its crew members per turn. If that same tank had a crew member in Reloading on top of the two already present, they would have 4 actions to share among each other. Any other crew members present on the tank will not count towards the action pool.

On the topic of action usage, actions need to be divided between the crew members manning the systems, using the tank example where all systems as filled out, the crew may call for any of the following divisions, and more:

Piloting | Reloading | Gunnery
-------- | --------- | -------
2 Actions | 1 Action | 1 Action
1 Action | 0 Actions | 3 Actions
4 Actions | 0 Actions | 0 Actions

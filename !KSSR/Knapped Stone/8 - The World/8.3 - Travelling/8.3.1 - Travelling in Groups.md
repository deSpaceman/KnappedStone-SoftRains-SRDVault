A travelling group in Knapped Stone & Soft Rains is divided into two levels: The Fellowship and The Entourage.

The Fellowship refers to the core group of player characters, and essentially takes up the place of the Party from other TTRPG systems. The Entourage is the union of the Fellowship with any other Creatures they have accrued as followers.

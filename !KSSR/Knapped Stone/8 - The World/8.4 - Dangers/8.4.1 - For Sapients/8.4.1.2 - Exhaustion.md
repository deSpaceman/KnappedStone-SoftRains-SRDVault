Exhaustion is a grim specter, fogging the mind and muddling the focus of anyone that does not rest when they should. While exhaustion may seem like a non-issue initially, it is lethal to anyone willing to push themselves hard enough.

Just like [[8.4.1.1 - Hunger|Hunger]], you may think of Exhaustion as a tracker, but instead of having 15 days, it has only 9 days. To advance on the tracker, you must spend a day without engaging in a full [[7.2 - Rests and Breathers|Rest]].

On the 4th day of the tracker, you gain the Tired Condition. With the Tired Condition you gain a -2 penalty on Mind and Focus. The penalties leave you with the minimum of 1 on each Attribute.

On 7th day, you gain the Exhausted Condition. With the Exhausted Condition you gain a -4 penalty on Mind and Focus, and a -2 penalty on Body, Toughness, and Dodge. The penalties leave you with the minimum of 1 on each Attribute.

If you somehow survive long enough to move past the 9th day of the tracker, you fall to the ground lifeless, as your body is pushed to its limit.

If you are able to take a full Rest, you return to the previous, condition giving day of the tracker. In essence, if you sleep anywhere between the 7th and 9th day of the tracker, you return to the 4th day, losing the Exhausted Condition and gaining the Tired Condition. If you sleep anywhere between the 4th and 6th day of the tracker, you return to the 1st day, losing the Tired Condition.

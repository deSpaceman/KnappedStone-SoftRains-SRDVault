Hunger is a constant threat to anyone, in any setting, slowly creeping in, sapping strength and health until its bony hand drags the poor being into the afterlife. It is paramount that you and your fellows keep your rations in check and your bellies filled, otherwise, you might meet an untimely demise.

Hunger can be thought of as a tracker, composed of 15 days. The way to advance in said tracker is to spend a whole day without eating a single meal.

On the 4th day of the tracker, you gain the Hungry Condition. With the Hungry Condition you gain a -2 penalty on Body and a -1 penalty on Dodge and Toughness. The penalties leave you with the minimum of 1 on each Attribute.

On the 10th day of the tracker, you gain the Starving Condition. With the Starving Condition you gain a -4 penalty on Body, a -3 penalty on Dodge and Toughness, and a -2 penalty on Mind and Focus. The penalties leave you with the minimum of 1 on each Attribute.

If you somehow survive long enough to move past the 15th day of the tracker, you fall to the ground lifeless, as your body finishes digesting itself.

If you are able to eat a meal, you return to the previous, condition giving day of the tracker. In essence, if you eat anywhere between the 10th and 15th day of the tracker, you return to the 4th day, losing the Starving Condition and gaining the Hungry Condition. If you eat anywhere between the 4th and 9th day of the tracker, you return to the 1st day, losing the Hungry Condition.

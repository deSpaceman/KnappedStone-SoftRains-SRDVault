### Limb Paralysis
__Type:__ Barrier

*Author's Note: This Barrier only covers paraplegia, not tetraplegia, as the latter is quite hard to fit into the adventuring life. Alas, if you desire to make a tetraplegic character, talk to the Worldshaper and adapt this Barrier as needed.*

Limb Paralysis is a harsh, unforgiving condition, robbing a person of much needed mobility.

An individual with limb paralysis, specifically from the waist down, attempts to move without any form of aid, their Movement is halved (rounded down) and they move via crawling. They are also unable to execute any action dependent on speed or acrobatics without any form of aid.

People tend to treat those affected with paralysis as condescendingly as it gets, this mostly thanks to the reliance on aids, be them wheelchairs or exoskeletons, to properly move. On the topic of aids, the effectiveness of a given aid on neutralizing the effects of this Barrier depends on their sophistication, and some of them may have problems of their own.

__Effect Value:__ Extreme

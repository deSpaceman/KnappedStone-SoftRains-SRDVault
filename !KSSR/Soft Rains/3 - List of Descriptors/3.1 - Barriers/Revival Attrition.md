### Revival Attrition
__Type:__ Barrier

You were dead once, now you are not, but, unfortunately for you, someone has tried to avoid paying the price needed to bring you back to the mortal coil by using a Spell. The due has been taken from your soul.

Roll a D6, are permanently affected with the resultant effect from the list below. You can, alternatively, talk to the Worldshaper to define a custom effect for your character.

Dice Result | Effect
----------- | ------
1 | Your skin turns chalk white and you project a magic null zone within a radius of 100 Gridspaces around you. Within this zone, no magic can exist beyond the magic certain beings would naturally need to maintain their life and form, but they get afflicted with the Exhausted Condition while within the zone. This zone cannot be blocked and ignores all obstacles, independent of their nature.
2 | Your Attributes (with the exception of Luck) are locked on the state that you died, forever. You may not permanently better your Attributes (E.G.: Training, using items...), nor may you permanently lose Attribute Points (E.G.: Gritting your Teeth, using items...). Anything that would result in you permanently losing an Attribute Point will instantly Collapse you, if you are losing an Attribute Point as an alternative to Collapsing, you instantly die.
3 | You are not Sapient anymore. Lose the Sapient Keyword. Choose 2 between Speaks (Language), Tool User, and Trader, gain those Keywords. The Language of the Speaks (Language) Keyword can only be one of the Languages you began the game with. 
4 | Your memory is fragmented, you can barely remember things and, most importantly, you don't seem to retain memories right anymore. Choose 3 Knowledges you know that are either Hard Practical (with the exception of the Languages you began the game with) or above Journeyman level, remove them from your Knowledge list. If you have any Expertise Knowledge above Journeyman, reduce its level to Journeyman, you may not train an Expertise Knowledge above Journeyman level. You may not learn Hard Practical Knowledges.
5 | The revival process mutated your soul, making it project a terrible aura around you. All non-Sapient and non-Alien Intelligence Creatures aware of you treat you with hostility, and are very likely to avoid, attack, or otherwise mistreat you. All Sapient Creatures aware of you treat you with some level of disgust, and all Alien Intelligence Creatures aware of you take vile interest on you.
6 | Your soul has been split, one shard remains in whatever afterlife you ended up in while another was pulled back into the mortal coil. After every Rest, roll Focus, if you get at least 4 Successes, gain Disadvantage 1 for all rolls done until the next Rest. If you failed, on top of the Disadvantage 1 to all rolls, gain the following effects: All Spells have their Test Difficulty raised by half, rounded up, and if the Test Difficulty is Attack, you must roll with an extra Disadvantage 2. You may only have one Amulet active, independent of your Focus Attribute. Independent of roll results, Learning any Knowledge or Training any Attribute takes one extra month. All Sapient Creatures feel extremely distressed when they look into your eyes or any equivalents.

There is no way to remove or otherwise alleviate the effects of this Barrier. If you have Revival Attrition and die, you cannot be revived again.

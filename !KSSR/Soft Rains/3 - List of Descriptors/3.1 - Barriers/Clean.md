You were able to free yourself from your addiction... for now.

If you indulge in whatever your addiction was, you must do a Focus Roll. The difficulty of the roll is defined by the amount of times you have indulged with your previous addiction, starting at 1. Should you fail the roll, lose the Clean Barrier and gain the [[Addiction|Addiction Barrier]] at Mild Severity.

Under Worldshaper discretion, choose a substance or addicting activity, change the name of this Barrier to "Clean - (Name of Substance/Activity)". Depending on the chosen addiction, the Worldshaper defines the Effect Value of this Barrier.

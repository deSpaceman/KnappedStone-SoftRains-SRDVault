### Cosmetic Mutation
__Type:__ Barrier

You have a mutation that provides no benefits, but it still calls attention of the crowd and makes you stick out. It can be of three different types, as listed bellow:

- Repulsive: Pus spewing boils, smelly patches of skin, among other such unpleasantnesses are examples of Repulsive mutations. These will have people avoid you.
- Weird: Brightly colored horn-like growths, geometric worming skin patterns, among other such weirdnesses are examples of Weird mutations. These are so unique and recognizable they become your signature and are hard to hide.
- Limp: Underdeveloped vestigial tail, extra fingers in each hand, and other such not very useful in general mutations are examples of Limp mutations. Different people will react differently to these, some abhorring them, others treating them as weird curious.

This curse can be acquired multiple times. Each time it is acquired, specify the mutation and the type as such as such:
"Cosmetic Mutation - (Mutation, Type)"
It cannot be a repeated mutation.

__Effect Value:__ Minor

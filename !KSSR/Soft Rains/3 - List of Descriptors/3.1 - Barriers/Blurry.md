### Blurry
__Type:__ Barrier

Being Blurry is an unforgiving condition, a curse that limits an adventurer's arsenal to only mundane, non-magical tools.

A person with Blurring can barely use spells (Disadvantage 4 on Spell rolls) and any attempt to activate an item with latent magic, like an [[3.3.6 - Amulets|Amulet]], is met with a Mind Test with difficulty 4. Alas, not is all bad, magic effects that would affect the mobility of a Blurry person lasts the minimum amount of time, as it struggles to grasp them.

An individual affected with Blurring has chalk white stains around their body and this is a condition that is already present at birth. People tend to treat Blurry with the same indifference they would treat any stranger, with one exception: societies that rely too much on magic may treat a Blurry with the same condescending gaze that a society reliant on vision might treat a blind person.

__Effect Value:__ Mild

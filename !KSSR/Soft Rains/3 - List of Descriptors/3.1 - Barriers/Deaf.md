### Deaf
__Type:__ Barrier

Deafness comes from many sources, birth, irreparable harm to the hearing apparatus, medical conditions, etcâ€¦ It is a condition that, while debilitating for adventurers, is manageable by the many resources that are available to ease communication between those that hear and those that don't, that is, if the hearing companions bothered to learn said resources.

People tend to treat the deaf with varying degrees of condescending behavior, some treat them as children, while others express annoyance at the fact they can't hear (all the while vehemently denying any chance they have to learn other means of communication with them). Fortunately, every rule has their exceptions, and those afflicted with deafness can always find people who treat them on equal footing.

### Addiction
__Type:__ Barrier

You have an itch, and the compulsive desire to scratch it, be it chemical or psychological, you are addicted to something. Addictions can have variable levels of severity, each amplify the effects of the Withdrawal Condition and the time it takes to get into Withdrawal when not indulging.

The levels of Severity are as follows:

- Mild: 1 Week without indulging results in Withdrawal. Withdrawal Condition is maintained as described by the base condition or the substance;
- Moderate: 3 Days without indulging results in Withdrawal. Disadvantages from the Withdrawal Condition raise 1 level, Focus Attribute is reduced by 1, to the minimum of 1, until the condition is resolved;
- Severe: 1 Day without indulging results in Withdrawal. Disadvantages from the Withdrawal Condition raise by 2 levels, Focus Attribute is reduced by 3, to the minimum of 1, until the condition is resolved.

If you are able to power through Withdrawal for an amount of time dictated by the Severity level of your addiction (2 Months, 6 Months, and 1 Year, respectively), reduce the Severity level. If the Severity level is Mild, and you manage to power through, lose the Addiction Barrier and gain the [[Clean|Clean Barrier]].

Under Worldshaper discretion, choose a substance or addicting activity and a Severity level, change the name of this Barrier to "(Severity) Addiction - (Name of Substance/Activity)". Depending on the chosen addiction and its severity, the Worldshaper defines the Effect Value of this Barrier.

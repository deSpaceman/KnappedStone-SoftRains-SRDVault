### Unstable Magician
__Type:__ Barrier

Unstable Magicians are people who have a hard time conducting and controlling energies related to [[3.4.2 - Arcane Spellcasting|Arcane magic]]. Souls are pushed backwards through circuits, magic streams cross or unravel with no reason, or control of the spell is simply lost, altered by latent magic in the environment and changing its output.

As such, any Unstable Magician that gets at least one Mishap when rolling for a spell must roll the Magic Instability table indicated by the Worldshaper (If there is none, the table on the Preset Tables chapter of this book will suffice).

Unstable Magicians tend to have some markings of their magic misadventures if they happen to be a caster, maybe a fully functional but distorted limb or a tuft of unnaturally colored hair, either way, the implications of such changes should be discussed with the Worldshaper. People tend to avoid Unstable Magicians, although only when they have the means to cast magic, depending on the markings a person affected with this condition has, they may be avoided due to superstition.

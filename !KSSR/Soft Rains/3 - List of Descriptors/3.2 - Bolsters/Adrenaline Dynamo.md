### Adrenaline Dynamo
__Type:__ Bolster

Your body, for some reason, appears to use whatever hormones or mechanisms it has for survival to their maximum capacity. This has the odd outcome of you surviving the most dangerous scenarios, albeit not unscathed.

Any time you decide to [[5.6.1 - Hitting 0 HP|Grit your Teeth or Get Gutted]], choose an effect from the list below.

- Gain an additional Physical Power 2 to every attack;
- Gain an extra 2 Movement, disregarding the 8 point maximum;
- Gain Advantage 2 on any [[5.3.3 - Attacking and Defending|Defense Rolls]] you execute.

You have that effect for an amount of [[5.3.7 - Time in Battle|Rounds]] equal to half the amount of [[2.4.1 - Attributes|Health]] you healed by your choice, rounded down.

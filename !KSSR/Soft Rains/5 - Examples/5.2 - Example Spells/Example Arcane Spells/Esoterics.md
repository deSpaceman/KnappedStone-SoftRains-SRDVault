The measures given in the text of this spell may be adjusted to better fit a given setting.

The User creates up to three effects, which can be repeated, from the list bellow within range.

- Create a harmless illusion, like a slight breeze, faint music, a vile odor, a sweet taste, or spark of light;

- Instantly turn a source of light on or off;

- Instantly clean or dirty an object of at most 1 cubic meter;

- Harmlessly heat or chill and object of at most 1 cubic meter. The heating/chilling is not enough to stave off the elements;

- Create a symbol or marking, up to 5x5 meters in size, at a surface;

- Form an bauble that can fit on your palm. It is solid, and seems legitimate at a distance, but under close inspection, it is clearly illusory.

Unless describe as instant, the effects remain active until concentration is broken, willing or not. All effects are under Worldshaper discretion.

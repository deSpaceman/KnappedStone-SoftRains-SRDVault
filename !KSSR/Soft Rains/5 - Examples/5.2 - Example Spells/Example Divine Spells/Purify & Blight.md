*Keywords*: 

*Mantra Difficulty*: 1
*Test*: Focus (Difficulty 1)

The User purifies or blights up to 5 meals worth of food. Purification only works on food that is normally safe to eat, but for some reason currently isn't (E.G.: Moldy bread, rotten fruit, spoiled milk). Blighting turns food that is currently safe to eat into not safe to eat.

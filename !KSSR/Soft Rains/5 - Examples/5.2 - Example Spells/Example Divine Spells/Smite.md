### Smite

*Keywords*: 4 Variable Power (Read Spell description)

*Mantra Difficulty*: 3
*Test*: Mind (Attack)

The User calls upon the power of their deity or belief to smite a Target. The type of Weapon Power this Spell outputs depends on the elemental attunement of the deity or belief in question.

For example, the Smite Spell listed in the Spellcasting List of a fire god will have 4 Fire Power and will probably be called Fiery Smite, while the one in the Spellcasting List of a god of light will have 4 Radiant Power and will likely be called Radiant Smite.

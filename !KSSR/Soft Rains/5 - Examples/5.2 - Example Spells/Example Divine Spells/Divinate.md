### Divinate

*Keywords*:

*Mantra Difficulty*: 2
*Test*: Mind (Difficulty 3)
*Material*: Hourglass with White Sand (-1 Mantra Difficulty, Preserved)

The User calls upon their deity or belief and asks a question. The Worldshaper gives a vague answer in the form of a vision. The vision has some limitations: it can only relate to actions and events.

A User of the Divinate Spell can't discover who the Pirate King is via a vision, but they can see the Pirate King commanding their crew to loot a nearby town. They cannot find out where the vault that holds Tear of the Sun is, but they can be told the moment the next patrol will come through the area. Examples go on.

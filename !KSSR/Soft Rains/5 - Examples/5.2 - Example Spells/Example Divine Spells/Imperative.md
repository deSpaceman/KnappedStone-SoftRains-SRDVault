### Imperative

*Keywords*: Lesser Range

*Mantra Difficulty*: 2
*Test*: Mind (Contested with Focus)

The User speaks a one word command to a Target within range and within line of sight. The User must roll Mind and the Target must contest it with a Focus roll, if the User succeeds, the Target obeys the command immediately at the cost of one of their Actions, otherwise, the spell fails.

If the word used as the command has multiple meanings (E.G.: Commanding a mage to "Freeze"), how the Target interprets it is up to Worldshaper discretion combined with any clarification provided by the User (For the example given, the User wants the Target to spend an Action staying still).

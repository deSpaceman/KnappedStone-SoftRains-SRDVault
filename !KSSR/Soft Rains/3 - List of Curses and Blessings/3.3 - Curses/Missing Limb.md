### Missing Limb
__Type:__ Curse

Missing a limb is not an uncommon occurrence in an unforgiving wilderness. Most adventurers learn how to deal with a missing arm, leg and/or opposable thumb. The effects of some types of limb are listed below.

- Arm, Forearm and Hand - Disadvantage or outright inability to execute actions that depend on two or more arms. The creature cannot use two or more handed weaponry, granted the amount of arms they do not have match what is asked in the keywords of the item. Effect Value: Major
- Leg and Foot - Halved (rounded up) movement or crawl speed, whichever makes more sense, disadvantage or outright inability to execute actions that depend on speed. Effect Value: Major

This curse can be acquired multiple times. Each time it is acquired, specify the missing limb as such:
Missing Limb: (Limb)
It cannot be a repeated limb.
There are ways to negate the effects of this curse, namely using prosthetics. The effectiveness of the prosthetic is defined by how sophisticated it is.

__Effect Value:__ Variable, check the description of each instance of this curse.

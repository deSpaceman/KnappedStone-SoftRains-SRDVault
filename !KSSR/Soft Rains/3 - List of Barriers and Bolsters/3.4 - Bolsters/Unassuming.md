___
### Unassuming
__Type:__ Bolster

You are extremely... regular looking. This isn't a joke, you are the closest someone can be to the average exemplar of your sapients.

People have a hard time latching on to any descriptors about you, having to make Mind Test with difficulty 5 to even remember one that isn't "Average something".

Of course, if you are in a situation where you would naturally stand out (E.G.: Being a towering Sapient in a crowd of small Sapients), the Worldshaper may elect to have this Bolster not apply. If you end up acquiring any Barrier or Bolster that contradicts the requirement, lose this Bolster.

__Effect Value:__ Mild

__Requirements:__ No Barriers or Bolsters that result in you having notable traits.

### Sinner
__Type:__ Barrier

You have done something horrid. Maybe you knowingly gave the orders that would kill millions, razed an important holy site, or executed a ritual so vile even the order of nature abhors it. Talk to the Worldshaper to define your sin.

Whatever it was, it doesn't matter where you go, people seem to know what you did. While this will not affect you mechanily, it will affect you narratively, as, even if someone doesn't know exactly what you did, they naturally feel that you did something repulsive and will react accordingly.

__Effect Value:__ Major

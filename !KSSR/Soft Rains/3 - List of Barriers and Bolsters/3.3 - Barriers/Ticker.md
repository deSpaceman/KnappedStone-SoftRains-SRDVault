___
### Ticker
__Type:__ Barrier

You are living on borrowed time. Be it due to a deadly disease, a slow-acting poison, a withering curse, or vile technology, you are going to die, you just don't know when.

At the start of every session, the Worldshaper rolls using your Luck Attribute in secret. If the result is all the same numbers, your time is up and you will die, preferably, in a dramatic moment. Having 1 or less Luck will result on your death, but look on the bright side, you at least knew it was coming this time.

__Effect Value:__ Extreme

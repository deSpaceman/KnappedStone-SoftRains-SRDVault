### Dull
__Type:__ Barrier

Being Dull is an unforgiving condition, a curse that limits an adventurer's arsenal to only mundane, non-magical tools. A person with Dull can barely use spells (Disadvantage 4 on Spell rolls) and any attempt to activate an item with latent magic, like an Amulet, is met with a Mind Test with difficulty 4. Alas, not is all bad, magic attacks that would affect the mobility of a Dulled person lasts the minimum amount of time, as it struggles to grasp the Dulled.

An individual affected with Dull has chalk white stains around their body and this is a condition that is already present at birth. People tend to treat Dulled with the same indifference they would treat any stranger, with one exception: societies that rely too much on magic may treat a Dulled with the same condescending gaze that a society reliant on vision might treat a blind person.
